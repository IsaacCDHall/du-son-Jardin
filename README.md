# DuSonJardin

## Getting Started

Every image asset in this project was custom created from scratch in sketch and each sound is copyright free.

1. Clone Project (revival branch is set to default)
2. `npm install`
3. `ng serve` for dev or `ng serve --prod` for optimized
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files
5. Type or click the screen and be sure to check out mobile!

* google icon is currently not in use and Oauth has been removed

If issues occur, try running `npm audit` at project base and then `ng serve` again.

## Further Exploration / Future Updates

* split screen between melodic and rhythmic
* ngAudio
* ngAnimate


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## In Conclusion

Tests are no longer implemented in the project's current state.
In the future, I would like to refactor the code to be more DRY as well as create more elaborate and custom animations for each image imported. I believe this idea has great potential and the execution through angular does not quite live up to the quality of ideas and assets that went into it.

## Credits

This project was a group effort back in April, 2019 and the revival branch is an effort to bring this back to life as many packages had depreciated and animations were never functional beforehand. I owe a big thanks to everyone from Epicodus who helped in the creation of this project! I encourage you to go check them out on LinkedIn
